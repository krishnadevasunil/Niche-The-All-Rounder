# Niche-The All Rounder
 The goal of this project is to extend a helping hand to student who are our future hopes. Molding students for a better tommorrow by teaching them how to utilise time available effectively and productively with a perfect plan is the main aim of NICHE.. Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment so our app's first and foremost aim is to provide the student with a disciplined life by createing a perfect timetable from the given data by the student like the accadamic status,ongoing daily routine etc. A timetable that will include all the necessary tasks like his/her early morning workout plans to the oerfect eight-hour sleep which most of the students lack. The second aim of this app is to help you to arrange all your online odf,textbooks etc into appropriate different folder. Once you got the pdf as message you can directly move it to the folder you wanted. It is said that you will never find time for anything, if you want time you must make it. Yes that's what NICHE does it will hold your hands and will surely lead you through the path of success.
